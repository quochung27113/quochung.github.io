        <h3>More Dinosaur Details</h3>
        <p>This scary dinosaur really could grow into the largest carnivore of them all.
            King of the meat eaters, it is believed they ate fish, and lived on both land and water (like a crocodile).
            They are the only true aquatic swimming dinosaur!
        </p>
        <img src="img\dino6\dino6-2.jpg" alt="thoidai">
        <p>They lived in the Cretaceous period with all sorts of other huge Cretaceous dinos including the T. Rex and
            Albertosaurus.

        </p>
        <img src="img\dino6\dino6-3.jpg" alt="anhkhunglong1-3">
        <p>The Spinosaurus had powerful jaws with straight teeth. Most other meat eating dinosaurs have curved teeth.
            Scientists thinks this means they would shake their prey to tear off pieces.

            Its classification is Saurischia (lizard hips).</p>

            This dino had an amazing sail coming out of its back. The sail was made from spike shaped bones, joined
            together by a layer of skin.

            Scientists are not sure what the sail was for. It may have been used to control its body temperature. By
            turning the sail to the sun it could have warmed its blood faster than other cold-blooded reptiles.</p>
        <h3>Where did they live?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino6\dino6-5.jpg" alt="bando">
        <p>Skeletons have been found in North Africa.</p>
        <h3>How big are they?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino6\dino6-6.jpg" alt="kichthuoc">
        <p>There is still a lot of discussion among scientist about the true size of this huge dinosaur, as lots of
            estimates have to be made.

            Current figures say they weigh around 7000kg-20900kg (7 to 20.9 tons) and could grow 12.6 to 18 metres (41
            to 59 feet) long. The skull alone was 1.75 meters long (5.7 feet).</p>
