        <h3>More Dinosaur Details</h3>
        <p>These dinosaurs were herbivores. Scientists are not exactly sure what they ate, but they probably grazed
            these Cretaceous plants.</p>
        <img src="img\dino5\dino5-2.jpg" alt="thoidai">
        <p>They lived 126-125 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous Period.</p>
        <img src="img\dino5\dino5-3.jpg" alt="anhkhunglong1-3">
        <p>Iguanon had a really long little finger which it used to gather food. Their thumbs had spikes on top to help
            them stab food. And their teeth would be replaced throughout their lives to help them chew tough plants.

            They may also have used their thumb spike to protect themselves against predators.

            Its dinosaur classification is Ornithopoda.</p>

        <p>
            Although Ornithopod dinosaurs are usually bird like dinosaurs that walk on two feet - these dinosaurs walked
            around on all fours as their arms were just 25% shorter than their legs.</p>
        <h3>Where did they live?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino5\dino5-5.jpg" alt="bando">
        <p>Most Iguanodons lived in Europe (including England, Belgium and the Isle of White) but fossils have also been found in Africa and North America. </p>
        <h3>How big are they?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino5\dino5-6.jpg" alt="kichthuoc">
        <p>They were big and bulky - growing to about 12 meters (39 feet) long. Their weight meant they wouldn't have been fast. It is thought they could get up to about 14 miles per hour.</p>
