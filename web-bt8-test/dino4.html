        <h3>More Dinosaur Details</h3>
        <p>These massive dinosaurs were meat eaters (carnivores) eating other cretaceous dinosaurs. It is thought they
            may have hunted in packs.</p>
        <img src="img\dino4\dino4-2.jpg" alt="thoidai">
        <p>They lived about 97 million years ago - in the late cretaceous period. This was earlier than more well known
            dinosaurs such as Triceratops or T. Rex.</p>
        <img src="img\dino4\dino4-3.jpg" alt="anhkhunglong4-3">
        <p>This is one of the biggest meat eating dinosaur ever discovered. Even bigger than the dinosaur T Rex - but a
            little bit smaller than the Spinosaurus.

            Despite its size it had a tiny brain! About the size of a small cucumber.

            Its dinosaur classification is Saurischia.</p>

            It is thought these dinosaurs would have hunted large herbivores like the Titanosaur. It would have had an
            excellent sense of smell. Its teeth were shorter and narrower than those of the T.Rex - but good for slicing
            flesh.</p>
        <h3>Where did they live?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino4\dino4-5.jpg" alt="bando">
        <p>Fossils of this dinosaur have been found in Patagonia in southern Argentina.

            The first fossils were found by an amateur fossil hunter called Ruben Carolini, in 1993.</p>
        <h3>How big are they?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino4\dino4-6.jpg" alt="kichthuoc">
        <p>They are considered to be one of the largest meat eating dinosaur. The bigger males would have weighed over
            13 tons. It is estimated that their skulls would have been 6.40 ft in length.</p>
