        <h3>More Dinosaur Details</h3>
        <p>These dinosaurs were herbivores - which means they were plant eaters. It is thought to be a 'high feeder'
            like a giraffe - eating leaves on trees up to 9 metres high.</p>
        <img src="img\dino2\dino2-2.jpg" alt="thoidai">
        <p>They lived about 154 to 153 million years ago - in the late Jurassic period. This was at the same time as the
            Diplodocus and Stegosaurus dinosaurs.</p>
        <img src="img\dino2\dino2-6.jpg" alt="anhkhunglong1-3">
        <p>Scientists believe that the Brachiosaurus was a warm blooded dinosaur, like mammals.

            Its dinosaur classification is Sauropod.</p>
        <img src="img\dino2\dino2-3.jpg" alt="chitiet">
        <p>
            Braciosaurus had longer legs at the front than at the back. Unlike other Sauropods, it would not be able to
            rear up on its hind legs. It also has a shorter tail than other sauropods.</p>
        <h3>Where did they live?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino2\dino2-4.jpg" alt="bando">
        <p>Fossils have been found in Colorado. Only one skull has been found. Fossils similar to the Brachiosaurus have
            been found in Africa and Europe - but scientist believe they are different enough to be different dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <h3>How big are they?</h3>
        <img src="img\dino2\dino2-5.jpg" alt="kichthuoc">
        <p>They were were around 25 metres long (85 feet) in length and weighed 40 tons. They could reach up 9 metres
            high - the same as two double-decker buses stacked on top of each other.</p>
