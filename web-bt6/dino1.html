        <h3>More Dinosaur Details</h3>
        <p>Although they were top carnivores, they still had to be careful of their large and powerful prey. An
            Allosaurus fossil has been found that had been badly wounded by a Stegasaurus.</p>

            Diplodocus and Stegosaurus dinosaurs.</p>

            The backbone of this dinosaur was different to that of other dinosaurs, which is where the meaning of the
            name 'different lizard' comes from. They also had lots of teeth - some up to 10cm long. They shed their
            teeth frequently and scientists have found a lot of them.</p>
